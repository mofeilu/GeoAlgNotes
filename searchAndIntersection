Segment Segment intersection
---------------------------------------------
Calculate the intersection of line segment Lab and Lcd, where a, b, c, d are points in 2D plane
We already know how to tell if two line segments intersect (use 4 CCW calculation), but in order to 
find out the intersection point, we need different alg.

Idea:  the point p on line Lab could be parameterized as :  p(s) = a + s*(b-a),  
similarly,  point q on line Lcd could be written as: q(t) = c + t*(d-c).

Intersection of Lab and Lcd need:  p(s) = q(t), which can be expanded as:
(bx – ax)*s  +  (cx –dx)* t = cx – ax
(by – ay)*s  + (cy – dy)* t = cy – ay

The determinant:  Delta = (bx – ax)*(cy-dy) – (cx-dx)*(by-ay)

When delta != 0,  line Lab and Line Lcd are not parallel and  will intersect at point given by parameter s, t.
Solve for s and t,  if 0<=s<=1 && 0 <=t <=1,   we can tell line segment Lab and Lcd intersect.

There’s one exception of the above algoritm, if Lab is collinear with Lcd and they overlap,  
we need additional routine to deal with that

Segment plane intersection
-----------------------------------------
Assume we have triangle T = abc and line segment qr,  we need to determine if qr intersect abc.  
(this has important application such as ray tracing in computer graphics)

To solve this problem, we need first determine if qr intersect with plane containing triangle abc.

We again use a parameterized approach:  any point p on line qr would be:
p(t) = q + (r-q) * t
Assume that plane determined by abc has normal vector N, 
then for any point x on plane, we have :   dot(x, N)  = D,  where D is the distance from origin to plane.

We can solve N by cross product of vector ab and vector ac  (assume a, b, c form CCW)  and normalize:
N = ((b – a)  X  (c – a)) /  norm( (b- a) X (c-a) )
D = dot(a, N)

Then for the intersection of line qr to the plane, we should have:
Dot(p(t), N) = D 
--> Dot(q + (r-q)*t,   N) = D 
--> t = (D – dot(q, N) ) / dot(r-q,  N)

If dot(r-q, N) != 0 &&  0<=t <=1,  we can confirm that line segment qr intersect plane abc.
Again, we need additional routine to deal with the case that qr parallel to plane abc but is in plane abc.

Segment triangle intersection
----------------------------------------
Once we determined segment plane intersection point p, all that left is to determine if p is in the triangle.
Although our problem is 3D, here we are essentially dealing with a 2D problem.

There’re plenty of ways to solve this “is p in the triangle” problem, one formal way is to use “barycentric Coordinates”, 
here is the definition:
Barycentric coord of point p w.r.t trangle abc are the real triplets (l, m, n) that satisfy:
l*a + m*b + n*c = p,    l + m + n = 1.

The physical meaning of barycentric coord (l,m,n) is the mass you put on triangle vertices a, b, c 
so that the center of gravity is at point p.

Point p is within trangle abc only when its barycentric coord. Satisfy:
0<l<1,  0<m<1, 0<n<1.
If any of  l, m, n = 0,  then p is on the edge of triangle abc.

Another way to solve the 2D problem is to use “signed area”.
Point p w.r.t three edges of triangle abc would give 3 signed areas (by using vector cross product),
p would be in triangle abc if all 3 signed areas are of the same sign ( because we do not know if a-b-c is CCW or CW)

Then the remaining question is , how do we transform from 3D to 2D ?  
Strict transformation of x-y plane to plane abc is possible but unnecessary.  
Notice that linear projection conserve the topology of point triangle relation, 
we can simply project p and abc to x-y, y-z or x-z plane.  The specific choice depend on if abc is not perpendicular to that plane.  
This projection is simple because we can just throw away the third coordinate!
